### TODO 

- [ ] Cycling through stations does the first station more then once
- [ ] Need to test with a station that uses extended M3U 
- [x] refactor: Move the stations logic into the tuner task. 
- [ ] use case: Add a rotary controller to change stations 
- [ ] When changing stations there a a burst of "noise". Suspend play_music task for a bit to remove this. 
- [ ] Move the performance statistics code into a cfg section. Note: this is more challenging than thought.
- [ ] Get the program name and version for the HTTP User Agent from the Cargo.toml file
- [ ] Would be good to have a mute button, especially during development
- [ ] Look into using the radio-browser. See https://gitlab.com/radiobrowser/radiobrowser-api-rust
